# CapstoneProject
My Capstone Project from GA Sydney.

This project was made for a client who wants to open a hairdressing salon at Sydenham. With the used of Census data, the client wants me to predict the population of his targets in the next few years. I added some Sentiment Analysis (Reviewer's most Talkabout, Positive and Negative reviews and Topic Modelling) for the client to help in his decision making by scraping Google's reviews from salons near Sydenham.
